# angularbp

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

The yo generated project comes with ngRouter and without less. I just added ui-router and less (grunt-contrib-less) to it so I don't have to do it everytime I start a new project. 

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
